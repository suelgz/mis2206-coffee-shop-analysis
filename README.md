Coffee Sales – Business Data Analytics Case
Project Overview

This project analyzes coffee shop transaction data to understand how revenue changes throughout the day. The goal is to identify revenue concentration patterns and provide practical business recommendations based on data analysis.

Problem Statement

Revenue is unevenly distributed across different hours. Sales are heavily concentrated in morning hours, while early morning and late evening periods generate lower revenue. This imbalance may lead to inefficient staff scheduling and underutilized business capacity.

Analysis Approach

The dataset was processed and analyzed using Python. The main steps included:

Converting datetime data into proper format

Extracting hour_of_day for time-based analysis

Checking for missing values and invalid transactions

Aggregating revenue by hour

Visualizing revenue distribution

Key Results

Revenue peaks between 8 AM and 12 PM

10 AM generates the highest revenue

Off-peak hours show significantly lower performance

Revenue differences are mainly driven by customer volume

Business Recommendations

Adjust staffing based on hourly demand

Introduce promotions during low-demand hours

Increase transaction value during peak periods

Continuously monitor revenue trends

Tools Used

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
